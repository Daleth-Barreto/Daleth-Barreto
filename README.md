> Computer Systems Engineer (in progress)  
> Independent Researcher in Quantum & Neuromorphic Computing

I accidentally ended up working on **quantum error correction, neuromorphic hardware, and compilers**.

This was not the plan.

## 🧠 About Me (mostly unrelated to computing)

I like:
- 🍫 Chocolate  
- 😴 Sleeping (my strongest skill)
- 📝 Professors who forget to assign homework
- ⚛️ Quantum computing & emerging technologies (unfortunately)
- ❤️ Begging for affection (low success rate)
- 🥃 Tequila (moderate success rate)
- 🖋️ Tattoos & piercings
- 🍒 This cherry emoji that has been living in my brain since 2024

I build serious systems while pretending I’m not taking myself too seriously.

## 🔬 What I Somehow Work On

### Quantum Error Correction (QEC)
I try to make QEC decoders:
- faster than MWPM,
- simple enough to fit on real hardware,
- and honest about their limitations.

Current obsession:
**ConvSNN and GCN-SNN decoders** for Surface Codes (d = 3–7).

Pipeline I didn’t expect to learn:
**Stim → ML / SNN → RTL → FPGA**

No papers yet. Yes, I’m working on it.

---

### Neuromorphic Computing
- Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)
- Graph-based SNNs (GCN-SNNs)
- Hardware-first designs (because magic doesn’t synthesize)

Mostly done with:
PyTorch, Nengo, Rockpool, Amaranth HDL

---

### LazyA Programming Language
At some point I thought:
> “What if I just write my own language?”

So I did.

- Compiles to LLVM
- Has a real compiler pipeline
- Exists because scripting wasn’t painful enough

---

## 🧰 Things I’ve Touched (and survived)

- Amaranth HDL, Verilog
- Yosys, OpenLane
- FPGA boards that *almost* worked
- Embedded systems (Arduino / ESP32)
- PCB designs that passed DRC (eventually)

Quantum & research tools:
- Stim, Cirq, QASM
- Python, C++
- Wolfram Mathematica (for emotional damage)

## 🏆 A Very Unplanned Trajectory (2016 → now)

### 2016
- Won a **math contest**  
  🥇 First place  
  Still don’t know how.

---

### 2018 — Talent Land, Guadalajara
I brought robots. They mostly survived.

- Mars Exploration — participant  
- Gladiators in Motion — participant  
- OMRI:
  - Maze robot
  - LEGO Minisumo
  - Rescue robot  

(Everything worked *eventually*.)

---

### 2022
Apparently I didn’t stop.

- **OMI Finalist** (27th edition)
- Silver medals in:
  - State Informatics Olympiad
  - State Programming Contest (Morelos)
- National Robotics Tournaments:
  - Maze 🥉
  - Insect robot 🥇
  - INTELIBOTS maze 🥇

---

### 2023
Things escalated.

- Youth Trajectory Award in Science & Technology  
  (Congress of Morelos, twice now somehow)

- CYBORITZ maze 🥉  

- ROBODUCA:
  - Maze 🥇🥈🥉 (collected the full set)
  - Advanced Innovation 🥈
  - Line follower 🥉

- ROBOT RUMBLE:
  - Maze 🥇🥈🥉 (again)

- RIOTRONIC (Ecuador):
  - Insect 🥇
  - Turbine line follower 🥇
  - Maze 🥈
  - Line follower (pursuit) 🥈🥉
  - Minisumo 🥉
  - Minisumo + maze 🥉  

I promise this looked less organized in real life.

---

### 2024
- Youth Trajectory Award in Science & Technology  
  (yes, again)

- Google Programming Community Cup:
  - 2nd place overall
  - 2nd place regional
  - 24th place national  
  Rankings are weird.

---

### 2025
Now with more keyboards.

- Google Programming Community Cup:
  - 14th place national
  - 2nd place regional
  - 24th place overall (consistency matters)

- Coding Cup Sinaloa (ICPC):
  🥇 First place  
  Top 5 overall

- ICPC Mexico Grand Prix:
  Top 10 national

- ICPC Mexico Finals:
  19th place national  
  Best team from Morelos (plaque included)

### 2026
- IBM Hackathon  
  14 hours without sleep.  
  One language built.  
  Probably a loss with a bad aftertaste.  

Would I do it again?  
Unfortunately, yes.

---

## 🎓 Academic Side Quests

### 2025 — Speaker
- First National Multiproject Wafer Congress  
  (TECNM / CONAOM)

### Papers & Technical Writing (Accepted / To Appear)
- *Dynamic Drone Mesh Network for Scalable Quantum Key Distribution in Challenging Environments*
- *Design and Modeling of Integrated Circuits for Environmental Sensing, Biomedical and Microfluidic Applications*
- *Simulation of Secure Mobile Robot Communications Using QKD*

Somehow this counts as research.

---
## 💼 Work Experience (Surprisingly Real)

- **Freelance Engineer & Developer — 5+ years**
  - Full-stack development
  - Embedded systems & robotics
  - Custom software and hardware solutions
  - Consulting, mentoring, and projects that somehow shipped

Mostly learned by doing things that *had* to work.


## 🧪 How I Operate
- If it can’t run on real hardware, it’s not done
- Latency beats elegance
- Documentation saves lives
- Curiosity got me here; I’m just following it
